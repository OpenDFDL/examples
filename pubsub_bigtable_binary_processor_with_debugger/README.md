# Data Format Description Language ([DFDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Format_Description_Language)) Processor Example

This module is a example how to process a binary using a DFDL definition. The
DFDL definitions are stored in a Bigtable database.

The application send a request with the binary to process to a pubsub topic.

The processor service subscribes to the topic, processes every message, applies
the definition and publishes the json result to a topic in pubsub.

## Frameworks

1. Spring Boot
2. [Spring Caching with Redis/Memorystore](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-gcp/docs/current/reference/html/memorystore.html#_cloud_memorystore_for_redis)

## Libraries

1. [Apache Daffodil](https://daffodil.apache.org/)

## Setup Instructions

### Project Setup

#### Creating a Project in the Google Cloud Platform Console

If you haven't already created a project, create one now. Projects enable you to
manage all Google Cloud Platform resources for your app, including deployment,
access control, billing, and services.

1. Open the [Cloud Platform Console][cloud-console].
1. In the drop-down menu at the top, select **Create a project**.
1. Give your project a name = my-dfdl-project
1. Make a note of the project ID, which might be different from the project
   name. The project ID is used in commands and in configurations.

[cloud-console]: https://console.cloud.google.com/

#### Enabling billing for your project.

If you haven't already enabled billing for your
project, [enable billing][enable-billing] now. Enabling billing allows is
required to use Cloud Bigtable and to create VM instances.

[enable-billing]: https://console.cloud.google.com/project/_/settings

#### Install the Google Cloud SDK.

If you haven't already installed the Google Cloud
SDK, [install the Google Cloud SDK][cloud-sdk] now. The SDK contains tools and
libraries that enable you to create and manage resources on Google Cloud
Platform.

[cloud-sdk]: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/

#### Setting Google Application Default Credentials

Set
your [Google Application Default Credentials][application-default-credentials]
by [initializing the Google Cloud SDK][cloud-sdk-init] with the command:

```
gcloud init
```

Generate a credentials file by running the
[application-default login](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/application-default/login)
command:

```
    gcloud auth application-default login
```

[cloud-sdk-init]: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/initializing

[application-default-credentials]: https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials

### Bigtable Setup

How to create a Bigtable database instance can be
found [here](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/creating-instance)

#### How to add data to bigtable

The following
doc, [Writing to Bigtable](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/writing-data),
can be used to add data to bigtable to run the example.

This example connects to a Cloud Bigtable with a collection with the following
specification. The configuration can be changed by changing the
application.properties file.

```
    Table
     dfdl-schemas =>
         Column Family
            dfdl => 
               Column Family Qualifier => 
                   binary_example => {
                       'name': "binary_example"
                       'definiton':
                        "<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

                        }
```

This dfdl definition example can be found in the binary_example.dfdl.xsd file.

### Pubsub Setup

The following [doc](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/quickstart-console)
can be used to set up the topics and subscriptions needed to run this example.

#### Topics

To run this example two topics need to be created:

1. A topic to publish the final json output: "data-output-json-topic"
2. A topic to publish the binary to be processed: "data-input-binary-topic"

#### Subscription

The following subscriptions need to be created:

1. A subscription to pull the binary data: data-input-binary-sub

### Redis Setup

#### Installation of Redis Emulator

Please refer to this [doc](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/) to install a
redis emulator in your localhost

#### Initialized the server

```
   $ redis-server
```

### Basic commands to access the data

List all the keys

```
  $ redis-cli
   127.0.0.1:6379> KEYS *
   (empty array)
```

After running the example at least two times redis will show the processor in
redis

```  
   127.0.0.1:6379> KEYS *
   1) "processors::binary_example"

```

Delete a key

```
   127.0.0.1:6379> DEL "processors::binary_example"
```

Get a key

```
  127.0.0.1:6379> GET "processors::binary_example"
```

## Usage

### Initialize the application

Reference: [Building an Application with Spring Boot](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/)

```
      ./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

### Send a request

```
    curl --data "message=0000000500779e8c169a54dd0a1b4a3fce2946f6" localhost:8081/publish
